The first thing you should do is install the Node.js dependencies to start the application.
To install Node.js dependencies you're going to use npm again. In the application folder run this in the command-line:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Then install the bower components by bower. In the application folder run this in the command-line:

```bash
$ bower install
```

## Running Your Application
In the application folder run this in the command-line:

```bash
$ node server.js
```

and  just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it! Application should be running.
